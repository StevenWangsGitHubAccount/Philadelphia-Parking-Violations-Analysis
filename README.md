1. The total population for all Philadelphia zip codes
2. Total parking fines per capita for each zip code
3. Average residential market value for a zip code specified by the user
4. Average residential total living area for a zip code specified by the user
5. Total residential market value for a zip code specified by the user
6. The correlation coefficient for total parking fines per capita and total residential market value per capita
